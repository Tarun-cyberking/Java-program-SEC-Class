1. **Age.java** – Prompts the user for birth year and current year, then calculates and displays the age.
2. **AreaCircle.java** – Takes radius as user input and prints the area of a circle (using a stored variable for pi).
3. **ArithmeticOperation.java** – Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
4. **Array.java** – Creates an array of size 10, stores the squares of numbers in it, and prints one of the stored values.
5. **ArrayEvenOdd.java** – Accepts size and elements from the user, then counts how many numbers are even and how many are odd.
6. **ArrayInputSumAvg.java** – Takes array size and elements, displays them, and calculates the sum and average of the elements.
7. **ArraySearch.java** – Searches for a specific value inside an array and prints the index where it is found.
8. **BitwiseOperation.java** – Demonstrates bitwise operators: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), right shift (>>), and unsigned shifts (<<<, >>>).
9. **ConditionalOperation.java** – Shows an example of the ternary operator for decision making (condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false).
10. **Even.java** – Checks whether a given number is even or odd.
11. **GradeExample.java** – Prints the result/grade using conditional checks.
12. **Greater.java** – Determines the greater of two numbers.
13. **Greetings.java** – Takes the user's name and age as input and displays a greeting message including both.
14. **InceDecreOperation.java** – Demonstrates increment and decrement operations (++ and --).
